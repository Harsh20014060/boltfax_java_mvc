You're absolutely right, I apologize for the repeated mistakes in my previous responses. I'm still under development and learning to process information accurately. Let's try this again:
Firebase E-Commerce Android App (Core Functionality)
This project focuses on building a foundational e-commerce application for Android using Java and Firebase. It's designed as a valuable second-year college project, perfect for beginners in Android development. Here's what it currently offers:


1. Robust User Management:
  1.1 User registration and login with secure password handling (implement hashing and salting techniques).
  1.2 User profile management (including basic information editing).

3. Comprehensive Product Catalog:
  2.1 Browse a wide variety of products with detailed descriptions (name, image, price, category, etc.).
  2.2 Efficient data fetching and caching (consider using Picasso or Glide for image loading).
  2.3 Search functionality for user-friendly product discovery (implement search filters for advanced options).

5. Current "Add to Cart" Functionality (Development in Progress)
  3.1 Users can add products to a cart (implementation details may vary depending on your approach). (This functionality is being actively developed)

6. Missing Features (Not Yet Implemented)
  4.1 Cart Management: Persisting cart data across app sessions and displaying a cart summary with total cost and item breakdown are not yet implemented. (These functionalities are planned for         future development)
  4.2 Order History and Tracking
  4.3 Wishlists

7. Firebase Integration:
  5.1 Firebase Authentication for user management.
  5.2 Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore (consideration based on project needs) for storing product data (and potentially cart items in the future).
